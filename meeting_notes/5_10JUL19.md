# Meeting notes 10th July 2019
## Fifth meeting - wrap up review (for now) and get on with simulations

## Points going in:
* Randomness extractors - which ones to use? What does implicit/explicit mean?
* In the amplification paper, what is (n,log(1/d)) as a range?
* How do we perform an arbitrary rotation?
