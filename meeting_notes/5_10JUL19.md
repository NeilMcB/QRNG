# Meeting notes 10th July 2019
## Fifth meeting - wrap up review (for now) and get on with simulations

## Points going in:
* Randomness extractors - which ones to use? The one I sent
* How do we perform an arbitrary rotation?

## Todo:
* establish requirements of setting for polarisation generator - attacks are possible here
* implement randomness extractor - e.g. from paper linked in supplementary info or universal hashing
