# Meeting notes 23rd May 2019
## Questions going in:
* Demonstrate working QKD sim - use as demonstration of verification of SimulaQron? Tune qubit coherence time to study behavior?

-> Main issue with SimulaQron is timeout, can try fixing by writing my own client-server communication (may be a good exercise anyway)

-> Change to RNG format + test output against NIST?

* What is our 'starting point'? i.e. the scope of the project - do we assume we have some quantum system that can generate random numbers satisfying a certain property. Generate using mobile phone - beyond scope?
-> datasets/high-bandwith livestream of quantum-generated random numbers available; but even these describe implementation of various protocols to convert low(er) quality output into higher quality.

--> for e.g. vacuum-state based protocols, issue is the electrical noise in the circuit. Gaussian noise easy to simulate for bit/phase flips, adversarial noise - can we introduce a controlled noise into the system which causes output to fail/pass randomness test.

--> bitrate is common figure, but will be difficult (i.e. not possible) to simulate using SimulaQron - can discuss in protocol summary but not in simulations - is this okay?
