# Meeting notes 19rd June 2019
## Fourth meeting - discuss initial work on protocol summary

##Â Questions going in:
* show initial draft of Random Numbers Certified by Bell's theorem - is this along the right lines?
* restructure for 'final product'? spend more time definining what random number expansion is
* in the paper - n is the number of repeats in the experiment, if the input string is 'generated' from the seed, does the seed not have to be at least as long as 2n, or is it used as seed to e.g. PRNG ?

## What we discussed:
* draft looks good - send to Petros to read over after some updates:
  * remove comments
  * indicate where links to other pages may go
* the seed has to be of length >2n, the other scheme is explained in detail in the paper
* include implementation section

## TODO!

* update draft
* complete draft of randomness amplification paper 
* carry on with sims - begin by updating client/server comms + threads/locks then try to simulate this protocol.
