# Meeting notes 26th June 2019
## Fourth meeting - work flow and putting together reports

## Points going in:
* Implemented threading and "wrapper" for simQ -> can now do 10000 bit experiments in about a minute.
* Build up wiki pages - include simulation results here?
* Packaging everything together - create directory with cross-references & links to veriqloud.
* Writing in thesis - have examples and comparisons? e.g. compare my pseudocode to corresponding description in paper.
* Begun work on draft of [randomness amplification](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11345) - focus on standardising notation

* supplementary info P13 - why are U_0 and U_1 the non-trivial components, and why does B_est=0? Is it because of the chosen entangled state?

## Discussed

* Include description of specific randomness extractor
* Details of randomness amplification paper - looks good to try
* Would be good to include some initial simulation results in the progress report

## ToDo

* Send latest draft of Randomness Expansion outline
 	* binary pair -> pair of bits, for example
 	* include experimental implementation section
* Continue work on randomness amplification
* Simulate randomness extension and amplification
