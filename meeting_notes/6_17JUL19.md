# Meeting notes 17th July 2019
## Sixth meeting - discuss simulation progress

##Â Points going in:
* Implemented randomness extractor using Carter-Wegman hashing. Performance isn't great - if it matches theoretical bounds could just plot theoretical results?
* How to get SDP result? Using analytical lower bound. The formulas in the paper don't seem to match - are they actually equivalent?
* Begun writing thesis - can I send drafts over as I go?
