# Meeting notes 24th July 2019
## Seventh meeting - figure out exactly what we are going to test for

##Â Points going in:
* Certified randomness expansion: 
 * how does noise affect length of input required for given output? How does this (theoretically) vary with other randomness extractor implementations?
 * how robust is the output to noise (using Carter-Wegman hashing as extractor)
