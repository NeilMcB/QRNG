# Meeting notes 23rd May 2019
## Second meeting - discuss first steps to take after break

Literature review will be (ideally) uploaded to wiki.veriqloud.fr, study this to get a sense of the format required.

Three sections to consider: main bit "Quantum Randomness", with subsections "Randomness Extension and Amplification" and "Randomness Certification".

For a minimum working example of SimulaQron, consider e.g. the protocol based on BB84 (to be identified).

Meetings loosely scheduled for Wednesdays at 11am, but can be skipped/moved as needed.

## TODO!

Read some pages on [the wiki](wiki.veriqloud.fr):
* "How to submit" to understand required format
* Look at protocol library for examples, e.g. "Prepare and Measure Network stage"
Idenfity a simple protocol to develop a minimum working example from
