# Meeting notes 22nd Feb 2019
## First meeting - discuss project outline and goals

Consider motivations for randomness? Why do we want to apply quantum protocols? 

Quantum randomness comes in three forms
 * amplification - take not entirely random string and make it random
 * expansion - take short random string and make it longer
 * certification - verify that an untrusted device produces random numbers

How do we measure randomness? Compare quantum and classical cases.

Project will have three stages:
 1. review quantum randomness protocols - translate from physics language to CS, focus on key areas:
 	* functionality
 	* hardware requirements
 	* what features does this enable?
 	* pseudocode (i.e. in CS language)
 	* final discussion
 2. simulate protocols using SimulaQron:
 	* study how changing parameters (e.g. intensity) effect figure of merit
 	* illuminate what features should be targeted for improvement by experimenters
 3. novel development of existing protocol:
 	* identify a deficiency/area for improvement in an existing protocol
 	* develop new protocol to address this
 		* repeat section 2 for this new protocol?
	* __source of risk!__, what if improvement fails or we can't see one? _mitigation_: we will have reviewed multiple protocols before, have many options to try
	* e.g. ArXiV 1804:00640, most certifications require two devices, what if we could do it with one device, within computation assumptions?
