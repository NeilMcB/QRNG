A single-qubit implementation of QKD, based heavily off of https://github.com/SoftwareQuTech/CQC-Python/tree/master/examples/pythonLib/programming_q_network.

Usage:
	start.sh -- sets up SimulaQron network for BB84
	run.sh   -- perform one iteration of BB84 QKD (can be repeated)
	stop.sh  -- shuts down SimulaQron network
